## Wellcome ðŸ‘‹ 
This is my solution to the [Testimonials grid section challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/testimonials-grid-section-Nnw6J7Un7).

### The challenge
The challenge is a layout that shows five cards in specific order.
This challenge should be responsive and as close as possible to the template.

## My process

### Built with
- HTML5
- CSS
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- Media Query

### What I learned

I learned more about CSS Grid in this project.
I used 
```CSS
main {
  grid-template-areas: ;
}
```
and mixed it with some media queries to change my layout based on different screen
devices for better responsive result.

### Continued development
I still have some difficulty to use grid for responsive layouts.
